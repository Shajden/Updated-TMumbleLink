# TMumbleLink
This is a mod for Terraria using tModLoader that adds Positional Audio support through Mumble Link. This allows you to hear other players in a voice chat get louder or quieter based on position and distance.

This mod is meant to be used with the [Mumble](http://mumble.info) chat client.

Note: This mod is client-side only so you don't need to install it on a server. Also, the mod only works in multiplayer for obvious reasons.


## Requirements
* [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/)
* [tModLoader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/)
* [Mumble](https://mumble.info)

## Installing the Mod
The mod itself can be installed using Steam Workshop.

1. Open Steam
2. Navigate to the tModLoader workshop
3. Search for "UpdatedTMumbleLink" mod
4. Subscribe the mod
5. Open tModLoader and enable the mod
6. You're ready to play (if you setted up mumble)

## Setting up Mumble
After installing Mumble, launch the application and follow these steps to configure positional audio.

- From Mumble's starting screen, click Configure -> Settings
- Click the "Plugins" section
- Enable link plugin
- Click the "Audio Output" section
- Check positional audio and "headphones" checkbox

That's it for the setup! If you want to test it out, join a chat server on Mumble and also join a Terraria server.
When you join the game it should say "Mumble Linked!" in the chat and after a few seconds it should say "Terraria Linked." in the Mumble chat log.
